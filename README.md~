[MV-KEMS](http://www.dainf.ct.utfpr.edu.br/~adolfo/KEMS) - KEMS for Multi-Valued Logics
================================

The initial idea is to develop KE Systems for Multi-Valued Logics and implement them in [KEMS](http://www.dainf.ct.utfpr.edu.br/~adolfo/KEMS).

We will start with some experiments in using TDD to develop some basic features of multi-valued logics.
